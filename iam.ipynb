    "In this lab, you explore users and groups and inspect the associated policies in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. You also add users to the groups and verify the permissions that are inherited by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lab, you should be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore pre-created IAM users and groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspect IAM policies as they were applied to the pre-created groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow a real-world scenario, while adding users to groups with specific capabilities enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Locate and use the IAM sign-in URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test the effects of policies on service access."
